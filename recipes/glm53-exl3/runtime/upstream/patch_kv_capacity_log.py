"""Honest KV-capacity boot log for the hybrid model (log-only overlay).

The problem
-----------
``update_kv_cache_capacity`` (``v1/core/kv_cache_utils.py``) logs, once per
boot::

    GPU KV cache size: 1,553,140 tokens, Maximum concurrency for 1,000,000 tokens per request: 1.55x

The first number is ``int(max_concurrency * max_model_len)`` where
``max_concurrency = num_blocks / num_blocks_per_request`` and
``num_blocks_per_request`` is a SUM OVER KV-CACHE GROUPS of
``cdiv(spec.max_memory_usage_bytes(cfg), spec.page_size_bytes)``
(``get_max_concurrency_for_kv_cache_config``). For a single-group model that
is the pool's token capacity up to rounding, which is what the label suggests.
For this hybrid model (MLA + kpool tail + 4 mamba + DFlash2 drafter SWA, one
shared BlockPool with globally unique block ids) it is a concurrency figure in
token units: neither ``num_blocks`` nor ``num_blocks_per_request`` is logged,
``max_concurrency`` is printed to two decimals, and only their ratio can be
recovered. On this kit the line read 1.5M tokens while the pool was 643 block
ids (642 usable) and one cached 3584-token segment cost 38 of them
(1 MLA + 4 mamba + 33 drafter) -- about 57K tokens of cached conversation with
nothing running. Two reviewers independently read the line as a 1.5M-token
prefix cache. Upstream feature request: vllm-project/vllm#54662.

What this overlay does
----------------------
Immediately after the existing line (kept byte-identical) it logs, from the
SAME config objects the existing line is computed from:

* one line per KV-cache group: index, spec type, block_size, page size, blocks
  per ``max_model_len`` request (the same ``cdiv`` expression as
  ``get_max_concurrency_for_kv_cache_config``, so the two cannot drift), and
  whether the group takes part in prefix caching;
* one summary line: usable block ids (``num_blocks - 1``: ``BlockPool``
  permanently holds back block id 0 as the null block), the ids one aligned
  cached segment costs across groups (per group), and the resulting
  cached-conversation capacity at that alignment.

Log-only. No control flow, no allocation, no config mutation, runs once in the
engine core at boot. Knob ``GLM53_KV_CAPACITY_LOG``: unset or ``1`` = log,
``0`` = one line saying it is disabled, anything else = ``ValueError`` (a
typo'd knob must not silently pick a mode; the launcher rejects it first).
Any failure inside the derivation itself is a ``warning_once`` naming the
exception, and boot proceeds: the feature is diagnostic and must never take
the server down.

What the summary models (and what it does not)
----------------------------------------------
"Ids per cached segment" is the DENSE-retention cost with block-aligned hits,
i.e. what the managers' ``reachable_block_mask`` hashes when no retention
interval is set and hits end on scheduler-block boundaries:

* exactly ``FullAttentionSpec`` / ``MLAAttentionSpec``: every block is hashed
  -> ``alignment / block_size`` ids (1 here);
* exactly ``MambaSpec`` in ``align`` / ``all`` cache mode (read from the spec
  the manager acts on): one state per block -> ``alignment / block_size`` ids
  per group (1 each here);
* exactly ``SlidingWindowSpec`` / ``SlidingWindowMLASpec``:
  ``min(need, alignment / block_size)`` with
  ``need = cdiv(window - 1, block_size) + (1 if EAGLE group)`` -- the
  contiguous run a hit needs (``SlidingWindowManager._contiguous_blocks_for_hit``;
  33 of 56 here). Under ``GLM53_DRAFT_KV_COMPACT=1`` the exact
  ``SlidingWindowSpec`` EAGLE groups are looked up ending on the boundary and
  their managers retain no lookahead block (``patch_hybrid_prefix_hit.py``),
  so the +1 does not apply to them;
* groups that opt out of prefix caching (``KpoolTailSpec``): 0 -- a live block
  per request, never a cached one.

Alignment is the lcm of every group's block size, which is what the
coordinator asserts its scheduler block size to be (3584 here) when no
context parallelism rescales block sizes; under DCP/PCP > 1 the figure is
withheld. Any other spec class -- subclasses included, because a subclass
may come with its own manager and reservation rule (``SinkFullAttentionSpec``
keeps permanent sink blocks; ``KpoolTailSpec`` is scratch) -- and mamba cache
mode ``none`` / a mixed uniform group are reported as UNMODELLED and the
capacity figure is withheld rather than guessed. Not modelled on purpose: the
per-group retention overlay (#83) makes the drafter cost boundary tails only,
and fine-grained hits (#84) change where a segment may end; both are decided
later, in the coordinator, and the summary says which policy it assumes.

EAGLE detection mirrors the coordinator exactly: ``group.is_eagle_group`` when
any group carries it, else -- when ``speculative_config.use_eagle()`` -- the
groups whose unwrapped spec is an exact ``SlidingWindowSpec``
(``patch_hybrid_prefix_hit.py``'s ``_glm53_is_draft_swa_spec``), else every
group (the upstream fallback).

Conventions follow ``overlay/patch_indexer_workspace.py`` /
``patch_kpool_tail_slotmap.py``: pinned ANCHOR, MARK sentinel,
``verified_state``, ``prepare``, idempotent, atomic replace, pyc clear, drift
=> nonzero exit. Both sites are preflighted before either is written. Must be
applied AFTER ``patch_glm5_drafter_group.py`` (same file); it has no anchors
in common with any other overlay.
