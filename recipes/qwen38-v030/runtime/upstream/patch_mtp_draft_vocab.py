"""Patch nvidia/mtp.py for reduced-vocabulary drafting (FR-Spec style).

The MTP drafter carries its own BF16 ParallelLMHead over the full 248,320-token
vocabulary: 1.27 GB, read once per draft step. At MTP 3 that is three of the
four lm_head reads in an engine step, 3.8 GB of the ~15.6 GB a single-stream
step moves.

Draft sampling is greedy (`draft_sample_method` defaults to "greedy", and the
speculator only builds `draft_logits` for the "probabilistic" method), so the
drafter needs an argmax and nothing else. An argmax over a frequency-ranked
subset of the vocabulary is wrong only for tokens outside the subset, and a
wrong draft is *rejected by the target model at verification*, exactly like any
other bad draft. So this trades acceptance for bandwidth and cannot change what
the server emits.

The reduced head is used only through `get_top_tokens`, which the speculator
calls when `use_local_argmax_reduction` is set. `compute_logits` is left on the
full head, so every other path keeps full-vocabulary behaviour.

TP=1 only: the reduced head is a plain matmul, not a vocab-parallel one. This
repo is a single-Spark deployment, and the patch refuses to engage otherwise.
